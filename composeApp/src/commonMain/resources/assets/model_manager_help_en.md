# Model Manager Help

## Overview
The Model Manager allows you to configure which AI models are displayed in your app and how they are sorted.

## Features

### Model Display Configuration
- Enable or disable models using the toggle switch
- All models are enabled by default
- Disabled models won't appear in model selection dialogs throughout the app
- The enable state is recognized by the model's name, which means one model may be shown again after changing its name

### Sorting Options

- Sort by name (Z-A)
- Sort by cost (lowest first)
- Sort by cost (highest first)
- Use default sorting (recommended)
